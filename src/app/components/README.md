(II) Dynamically add components to the DOM 
  Inspired by Dave Rivera [https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/dynamically-add-components-to-the-dom-with-angular-71b0cb535286]
  We will use ViewContainerRef, which represents a container where one or more views (components) can be attached. This object is basically a $(<selector>) for Angular (DOM manipulation). Injecting this object into a Component’s constructor will give us that Component’s container and, with it, we can append a sibling Component to that container.

  Use Cases
  So, you might be wondering why you’d want to create a component from a service, don’t you? Well, you might have a process that’s running in the background, like an interval or a timeout, that needs to show a component (like an alert/notification or a modal) when certain conditions are given, and actually placing these components in a template and displaying them (or not) with a flag might bring along some other concerns like: Code duplicates, High Coupling, and your component will do things out of its purpose which implies more code (error prone).

  (II)::STEP_1 Create the Component to be dynamically added to the DOM
  (II)::STEP_2 Create a service loader to create the component
  (II)::STEP_3 Main component will inject it’s container (ViewContainerRef ) to the service
  (II)::STEP_4 Inside of app.module.ts add the dynamic components as an entryComponents. The entryComponents will create a factory so that when the ComponentFactoryResolver is called we are able to create an instance of the component and add it to the DOM
